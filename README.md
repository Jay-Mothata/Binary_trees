C - Binary trees

## Overview:

Binary trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child. These trees are widely used in computer science for organizing and storing data efficiently.

## Features:

Nodes: Each node in a binary tree contains a piece of data and references to its left and right children.
Root Node: The topmost node in the tree, providing the entry point for accessing the tree's elements.
Parent and Child Nodes: Nodes in a binary tree are organized hierarchically, with each node having a parent and possibly one or two children.
Leaf Nodes: Nodes with no children are called leaf nodes.
Height: The length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node determines the height of the tree.
Traversal: There are different methods for visiting all nodes in a binary tree, including in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.
Binary Search Tree (BST): A specific type of binary tree where each node's left child is less than its parent, and the right child is greater.
Operations: Common operations on binary trees include insertion, deletion, searching for a specific node, calculating height, and balancing.

## Applications:
Binary trees find applications in various domains of computer science, such as:

Representing hierarchical structures like file systems and organization charts.
Implementing data structures like binary search trees, heaps, and expression trees.
Optimizing algorithms for searching, sorting, and tree-based computations.

## Usage:
Understanding binary trees and their operations is essential for developers working on:

Algorithm design and optimization.
Database management systems.
Compiler construction.
Game development and artificial intelligence.
